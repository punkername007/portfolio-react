              Hi! I am Selene, a front-end developer originally from Argentina.
              I am currently traveling around Europe since I began a long
              journey to know and experience life beyond my country of origin.
              During the hard times of COVID, I got interested in programming in
              order to be able to create applications. For a few years now,
              studying programming and building applications has been part of my
              daily life (Just like good music and a cup of coffee). I enjoy
              building applications while learning to communicate with my travel
              companion (üíª‚ù§Ô∏è), since in short, she builds everything I develope
              in my head. I currently aspire to become a full stack developer
              and i'm glad that traveling doesn't stop me from learning. It
              keeps me motivated to improve as a developer. If you are
              interested in my work, feel free to contact me, i will be glad to
              work together.
            </p>
