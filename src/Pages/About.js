              Hi ! I am a traveler from Argentina who is currently traveling
              around Europe. I am an individual, passionate about learning and
              living new experiences, and these two passions have motivated me
              to begin a long journey to know and experience life beyond my
              country of origin. Through the years, I got interested in
              programming in order to be able to create applications, and for
              this reason I decided to learn to code. For a few years now,
              studying programming and building applications has been part of my
              daily life (Just like good music and a cup of coffee). I enjoy
              building applications while learning to communicate with my travel
              companion (üíª‚ù§Ô∏è), since in short, she builds everything I develope
              in my head. Traveling doesn't stop me from learning and allows me
              to continue training as a Developer. I currently aspire to become
              a full stack developer and my main goal is to build great
              applications while continuing this journey that has no return
              date.
